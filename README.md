## 1. Introduction about IdentityServer4

**IdentityServer4** is an **open-source** framework for implementing **Authentication** and **Authorization** in **ASP.NET Core** applications

It's based on the **OpenID Connect** and **OAuth 2.0** protocols, enabling secure identity management and access control for APIs, SPAs (Single Page Applications), web applications, and mobile apps

**Key Features**

**Authentication & Single Sign-On (SSO)**: IdentityServer4 allows applications to authenticate users and provide SSO across multiple applications

**OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Protocols**: It supports these widely used standards for secure authorization and authentication

**API Protection**: Protects APIs by issuing access tokens that can be used to authorize API requests

**Flexible Identity Management**: It can manage users internally, or integrate with external identity providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, Azure AD)

**Token Management**: Issues secure access tokens (JWT or reference tokens), ID tokens, and refresh tokens
